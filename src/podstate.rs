//! Centralized AirPods state coordination.
//!
//! Coordinates two data sources and notifies consumers:
//!   - AAP (exact) for the device an L2CAP connection is up to
//!   - BLE advertisements for every other device (10% steps, or exact once decrypted)
//!
//! The choice is per device, not global: an AAP connection to one pair of AirPods
//! must not stop a second pair from being tracked over BLE.
//!
//! # Why entries expire
//!
//! When no stored key decrypts an advertisement, its state is keyed by the
//! *randomized* BLE MAC - and those rotate for privacy, several per minute per
//! device. Without eviction the map grows for as long as the app runs. Every entry
//! carries a `last_seen` and [`Inner::prune`] drops stale ones.
